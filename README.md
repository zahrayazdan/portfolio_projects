# Predicting Profit Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to forecast profits based on various business factors. By leveraging historical sales data, the model helps in identifying key drivers of profit, enabling better decision-making for future business strategies.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:
- `Predicting_Profit_LR.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and Linear Regression implementation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for this analysis (ensure sensitive data is not shared publicly).
- `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project and findings.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution and key metrics.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features that impact profit predictions.
3. **Model Development**: Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights based on the model's findings.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data manipulation and model building.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Linear Regression model and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset includes historical sales data with the following features:
- `Order Date`: Date of the order.
- `Delivery Date`: Date when the order was delivered.
- `Quantity`: Number of items sold.
- `Retail Price`: Price per unit sold.
- `Cost`: Cost per unit.
- `Discount`: Discount offered on the sale.
- `Location`: Region of the sale.
- `Profit`: Target variable representing profit from each sale.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Convert date columns to datetime format.
   - Create new features like `Delivery Time` and `Discount Rate`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the relationship between features and profit.
   - Check for multicollinearity using correlation matrices.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Linear Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Adjusted R-squared: 0.7362
   - The model explained 73.62% of the variance in the target variable.

## Results & Insights

- Higher discounts negatively impacted profit, especially in the `East` and `South` regions.
- Shorter delivery times were associated with higher profits.
- Retail price and cost had the strongest influence on predicting profit.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio_projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio_projects
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predicting_Profit_LR.ipynb
   ```

## Conclusion

The Linear Regression model provides a good fit for predicting profits based on historical sales data. By optimizing pricing strategies and reducing delivery times, businesses can enhance profitability.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced regression techniques like Ridge, Lasso, or ElasticNet for improved predictions.
- Integrate external data such as customer demographics or economic indicators for deeper insights.
- Create a dashboard to visualize real-time profit predictions.
